# GPT-Heist
An LLM Prompt Engineering event where people put system prompts and user prompts head-to-head!

More info here soon™️

## Setup
This project consists of three parts, the frontend that takes in prompts, the backend that organizes and queues those prompts to shove into an LLM, and the LLM runner(s).

Create a `.env` file from `.env.example` in the root of the project tree. For development, create symlinks to .env files to the frontend and backend folders.
Docker compose will also use this .env file.
